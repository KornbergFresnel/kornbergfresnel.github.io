In 2015, DeepMind proposed their first distributed reinforcement learning algorithm architecture, known as Gorilla (General Reinforcement Learning Architecture). Before that, works on distributed deep learning focused on massively distributed architectures that can learn from more data in parallel and outperform training on a single machine. But all of them have focused on supervised and unsupervised learning, and there wasnâ€™t a distributed architecture or algorithm for (deep) reinforcement learning. This chapter will give a glance at the evolution of distributed reinforcement learning, covering algorithms and frameworks.
