I'm a researcher at [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), with core research interests in reinforcement learning, multi-agent learning, and machine learning systems. My current work focuses on integrating empirical game theoretical analysis into multi-robot interaction and multi-modality foundation research.

I hold a Bachelor’s Degree from [Sichuan University (2018)](http://en.scu.edu.cn) and a Ph.D. from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2023)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn), where I was advised by Prof. [Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net) and Prof. [Ying Wen](https://yingwen.io).

## Recent News

- 1st May 2025 - A paper entitled "Efficient Skill Discovery via Regret-Aware Optimization" has been accpeted by **ICML 2025**. We frames unsupervised exploration as a min-max game, and find skills which maximize Regret, as this suggests that the policy has not yet fully converged -- building on the success of regret in other domains such as UED.
- 6th Feb 2024 - We published a language-centered framework [OpenPAL](https://github.com/opendilab/openpal), integrating open-ended RL and LLM as an efficient solution for human-AI interaction
- 2nd Mar 2023 - A paper entitled "MALib: A parallel framework for population-based multi-agent reinforcement learning" has been accepted by the **Journal of Machine Learning Research 2023**
- 24th Dec 2022 - A preprint entitled "On Realization of Intelligent Decision-Making in the Real World: A Foundation Decision Model Perspective" has been published
- 7th Dec 2022 - We open-sourced a large-scale multi-modal pre-trained model on Github, [check it and star!](https://github.com/Shanghai-Digital-Brain-Laboratory/BDM-DB1)
