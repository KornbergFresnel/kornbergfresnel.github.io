Population-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (PB-MARL) refers to a series of methods combining dynamical population selection methodologies and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms.
Although PB-MARL has achieved impressive successes in some nontrivial multi-agent tasks, it suffers from low computational efficiency in sequential execution due to the heterogeneity in computing patterns and policy combinations. We argue for dispatching PB-MARL's subroutines via the combination of a stateless central task dispatcher and stateful workers, thereby leveraging parallelism at different components to solve this problem efficiently. This paper follows this principle and presents MALib -- a parallel framework that comprises a task control model, independent data servers and abstraction of MARL training paradigms. The source code is available at [sjtu-marl/malib](https://github.com/sjtu-marl/malib).
